title: "Starting a blog finally!"

Congratulations! You are reading the first post on my brand new blog! I've been contemplating starting a blog for a long time. Anyhoo, finally getting around to document my tiny footprint on the tech world.

**So, where do I begin with?**

Oh ya right, my search for a good blog platform. I toyed around the idea of using several different platforms but settled on using Jelyll via [Prose starter](https://github.com/prose/starter). The platforms I considered were:

- **[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)** (self host via [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application))
- **[Octopress](http://octopress.org/)** (self host via DigitalOcean)


   
I'm still interested in trying out ghost. Its super simple to setup via DigitalOcean droplet. Maybe for some other use. 

Octopress was a pretty good option. But I already have several Vagrant machines on my Mac Air and don't wanted another one I have to manage, just for blogging. I was looking for other options and came across a Hacker News post showing off [Contentify](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7711444). Saw a couple of posts on [Prose](http://prose.io/) there & that was pretty close to what I was looking for. A Jekyll aware Markdown editor that lets me easily create posts.
